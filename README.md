# Real Estate Price prediction

In this project, I solved the real estate price prediction problem on data of house from King County, WA, US.

I performed data wrangling, exploratory data analysis and machine learning modeling.

For modeling part, I used XGBoost-based gradient method for regression. I managed to obtain R2 of 0.90 (+/- 0.01). The results are satisfactory.
